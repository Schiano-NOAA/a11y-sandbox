# Tagged {asar} report with tables and figures


## Test

- create {asar} template containing figures from and not from {stockplotr} along 
with a table made from `gt` (code used from stockplotr but not live)


## Results


## Efforts to remedy the issue


## Notes:

- other testing in the `asar` repo when fixing the `add_alttext()` function showed
  that alt text was added to the documents, BUT you don't see them in a pop-up 
  like usual. Intead if you navigate to the figure tag, right click then select
  "Properties", you will see the alternative text box filled in which would be 
  (I'd hope) accessible to screen readers.
